# Tombino!
This is the github repository for the Tombino! rules. It is likely more complicated than it needs to be in terms of coding, as it was forked from a repository by a guy who (unlike me) knew what he was doing.
Nevertheless, the site is sort of working and can be expanded upon by anyone who wants to contribute: the rules are already there, at least.
